# Decentralized Rent Payment Escrow - Smart Contract


## **Introduction**
The **Decentralized Rent Payment Escrow Smart Contract** is designed to ensure secure, automated, and dispute-free rent transactions between landlords and tenants. This smart contract enforces timely monthly payments, manages security deposits, and provides a robust dispute resolution mechanism.

## **Problem Statement**
Traditional rent payments often involve various challenges:
- **Manual Transactions:** Tenants need to remember due dates and manually transfer rent every month.
- **Late Payments & Disputes:** Unpaid rent causes conflicts and disputes between tenants and landlords.
- **Security Deposit Issues:** Landlords may withhold deposits unfairly, leading to tenant dissatisfaction.
- **Legal Complexities:** Resolving disputes often requires lengthy and costly legal actions.

## **Solution: Decentralized Rent Escrow**
Our smart contract addresses these issues by providing:
- ✅ **Automated Rent Payments** – Ensuring landlords receive timely payments.
- ✅ **Security Deposit Management** – Holding deposits securely until lease termination.
- ✅ **Late Payment Penalties** – Enforcing financial discipline for delayed payments.
- ✅ **Dispute Resolution System** – Enabling a trustless mechanism for conflict resolution.
- ✅ **Lease Completion Security** – Ensuring funds are released only when the lease ends as per terms.

## **How It Works**
1️⃣ **Landlord Deploys Contract** – Defines the tenant, rent amount, security deposit, and lease duration.
2️⃣ **Tenant Deposits Security** – The tenant deposits the security deposit into the contract.
3️⃣ **Automated Monthly Payments** – The tenant sends rent monthly, which is automatically transferred to the landlord every **30 days**.
4️⃣ **Late Payment Penalty** – If the rent is late, the contract deducts a penalty.
5️⃣ **Dispute Management** – Either party can raise a dispute, temporarily freezing payments.
6️⃣ **Lease Completion & Refunds** – If no disputes exist at the end of the lease, the security deposit is refunded to the tenant.
